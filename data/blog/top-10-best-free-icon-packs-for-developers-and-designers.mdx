**Icons** are an essential part of any website, you'll need them to illustrate your point better, give more personality to your app or make it easy to navigate your website, especially on mobile devices when some words might be too long and an icon fits much better.

In this article, I compiled what I considered the **10 best free icon packs**, for both developers and designers to use, some of them have options to import to different formats, like _png_ or _svg_, and some of them you can install them and import them directly into your projects, which makes them much more convenient if you are working with a framework like **React**.

Let's begin!

## Heroicons

Made by the team behind [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and more specifically by [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger).

**Pros:**

- Export to SVG/JSX.
- Outline/Solid versions available.
- Very modern designs.
- React and Vue library available for easy imports.

**Cons:**

## Simple Icons

Thousands of free SVG icons for popular brands (and not so popular). If you need an icon for any brand or service, this is the place to go, they are really easy to use, they have packages for many different frameworks and languages and one distintive thing they do is that they give you the main brand color of the icon.

**Pros:**

- Export to SVG/PDF.
- Brand color of the icon.
- Use by CDN, NPM package, or Framework/Language-specific packages.

**Cons:**

- Only con is that it's so good that I wish that it had common icons so I wouldn't need to use anything else.

## Bootstrap Icons

- Export to SVG/PNG or use it as a font.
- Big collection.
