I'm passionate about content creation and helping other people in their coding journey. I create daily content on my Twitter about coding and tech.

My favorite stack right now is Next.js + Tailwind, as you can see from this blog!

On my free time, I like singing, playing music in my piano and guitar and rock climbing (but mostly indoors ðŸ˜¬)
